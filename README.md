# Have irrigated areas actually expanded around new irrigation dams?

This repository contains the code used in the analysis for the paper:

**"Have irrigated areas actually expanded around new irrigation dams?"**

The project evaluates whether irrigation dams lead to measurable expansion in irrigated cropland by combining satellite-based indicators, spatial analysis, and statistical modeling.

## Repository Overview

The repository is organized into the following components:

- `code/` — Scripts and notebooks for data processing, analysis, and visualization
- `outputs/` — Generated figures, tables, and intermediate results

---

## Workflow Overview

The analysis consists of three main steps:

### 1. Google Earth Engine Processing

- Script: `gee_irrigation_dam_analysis.js`
- Extracts spatial indicators (e.g., NDVI-based irrigation signals)
- Processes satellite imagery and command areas

The full GEE code can be accessed here:

### 2. Zonal Statistics & Spatial Aggregation

- Notebook: `Zonal_statistics_command_area.ipynb`
- Computes zonal statistics for command areas
- Aggregates irrigation and cropland statistics across spatial units

### 3. Visualization and Statistical Analysis

- Notebook: `Irrigated_cropland_areas_visualization.ipynb`
